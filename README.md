# UsedCarPrices
Data Cleaning + Exploration (EDA) + Prices Prediction (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting) + Segmentation of used car ads on Craigslist/German website( Cluster analysis using GMM).


## INTRODUCTION
Total of 50000 used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen. The content of the data is in German. The autos dataset download from Kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/kernels

Several questions can be asked while exploring the dataset such as:

### Q1 Can we predict the prices of the cars based on its criteria?
We are going to build a predictive model of the car prices based on the descriptions provided in the ads.

### Q2 what is the most popular car brands in the market (Germany) ? 
By computing the frequency of the ads of different car brands, we can get an idea of the popular cars in the German market.

### Q3 How do the used cars ads cluster together? 
How do the cars cluster based on their age, mileage, power, price ? What can the used car market inform us about the use of cars in Germany and which cars hold their value? What is/are the major determinant(s) of the price of a used car?

### Personal Motivation
My main motivation behind working with such data set is to practise data cleaning as this data set was quite messy with a lot of missing values and outliers.
