# UsedCarPrices
Data Cleaning + Exploration + Prices Prediction + Segmentation of used car ads on Craigslist (German website)


## INTRODUCTION
Over 370000 used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen. The content of the data is in German. The autos dataset download from Kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/kernels

Several questions can be asked while exploring the dataset such as:

### Q1 what is the most popular car brands in the market (Germany) ? 
By computing the frequency of the ads of different car brands, we can get an idea of the popular cars in the German market.

### Q2 Can we predict the prices of the cars based on its criteria?
We are going to build a predictive model of the car prices based on the descriptions provided in the ads.

### Q3 How do the used cars ads cluster together? 
Do the cars cluster based on their prices, brands, mileage?

### Personal Motivation
My main motivation behind working with such data set is to practise data cleaning and imputation techniques. 
A goal of this project is to compare the predictive model performance with different imputation techniques to help me understand better how to decide which imputation strategy to use based on the context.
