Several questions can be asked while exploring the dataset such as:

### Q1 what is the most popular car brands in the market (Germany) ? 
By computing the frequency of the ads of different car brands, we can get an idea of the popular cars in the German market.

### Q2 Can we predict the prices of the cars based on its criteria?
We are going to build a predictive model of the car prices based on the descriptions provided in the ads.

### Q3 How do the used cars ads cluster together? 
What are the cars that cluster together based on A. price, B. power C.Mileage ?

### Personal Motivation
My main motivation behind working with such data set is to practise data cleaning as this data set was quite messy with a lot of missing values and outliers.
